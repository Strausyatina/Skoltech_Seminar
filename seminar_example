# A tab-separated file with a header and a set of first info-lines, metadata.

# Count header&info rows and content rows (see 5.8. grep, sed, cut, awk; 5.7. Regular Expressions): 

grep -c "^#" clinvar_20171002.vcf 
grep -vc "^#" clinvar_20171002.vcf 

# Save metadata to a new file (vcf_header), the corresponding rows start with "##":

# 'CHROM', 'POS', 'REF' and 'ALT' columns are 1,2,4 and 5, respectivelly.

# Let us concider only point mutations. 
# Find the most mutable 'REF' nucleotide in 15 chromosome 
# i.e. the most frequent nucleotide in 'REF' column, limited to 15 chromosome (see 5.5. Pipes and Redirection):

# 1. Get all the rows, starting with "15" (see 5.8. grep, sed, cut, awk; 5.7. Regular Expressions)
# 2. Extract 'REF' column (see 5.8. grep, sed, cut, awk)
# 3. Select rows that contain one-letter "word" (see 5.8. grep, sed, cut, awk; 5.7. Regular Expressions)
# 4. Sort them alphabetically (see 5.4. Files and directories)
# 5. Merge consecutive equivalent rows, with counts (see 5.4. Files and directories)
# 6. Sort numerically from the most frequent to the least (see 5.4. Files and directories)
# 7. Pick the first line with the champion (see 5.4. Files and directories)
